## ✨ Why This Repository Exists

Every developer Googles the same things again and again.

This repository exists to:

* 🧠 Eliminate repeated Googling
* ⚡ Speed up debugging & development
* 📚 Build a second brain for engineering
* 🤝 Encourage team-wide knowledge sharing
* 🔄 Keep practical notes version-controlled

This is not documentation.
This is a **developer survival kit**.
